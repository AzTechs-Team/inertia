## What inspired us to make this project?

- The main idea was to create a platform for travellers to share their stories and inspire other to follow suit.
- As we are just getting out of a pandemic and lockdowns, it would be amazing to travel the world, in reality or virtually. This inspired us to create this application. 
- People can share photos of the places they visited, and we can live through them vicariously. This would also function as a bucket list, where people can scrach off the places they visited so far.

## Features

- World map with places visited
